AI-Based Emotion Detection System

📌 Overview

This project is a real-time Emotion Detection System using CNN, TensorFlow, Flask, and OpenCV. It captures live video from the webcam, processes facial expressions, and predicts emotions using a deep learning model.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV.

CNN-based emotion classification trained on a labeled dataset.

Flask API to serve predictions.

Web-based UI with live camera feed.

🛠 Technologies Used

Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras

Computer Vision: OpenCV

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

🔥 Future Enhancements

📈 Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.

🎙️ Add voice-based emotion feedback.

📊 Integrate a history tracker for past detections.

🙌 Acknowledgments

Inspired by Facial Expression Recognition research.
